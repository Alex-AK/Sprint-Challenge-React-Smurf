Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

- Client side routing has benefits because the data for a website is loaded initially. The initial load time will be a bit longer than normal, but once loaded, the user can navigate through the website without needing to request individual pages from a server.
- Server side routing is when the data a website needs is stored on servers. As the user navigates to a new page, the browser will make a request for the data it needs. The server will send the data and template files needed, the browser will refresh and render a new page.
